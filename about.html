    <h1>1st Workshop on Machine Learning on Edge in Sensor Systems</h1>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
<p>Sensors have become more ubiquitous through the spread of the Internet of Things and increased
market penetration of smartphones. The ensuing flood of data has the promise to advance the state of the
art in ways that could change the life of every human on the planet, including improvements in
healthcare, environmental management, and city management. To enable this revolution, machine
learning needs to fill the gap to turn raw data into an understandable and actionable system. However,
resource constraints, complex architectures, and challenging study designs and ground truth collection
are some of the many hurdles that must be overcome to bring a promising idea to reality in this
domain. Sensys-ML focuses on providing extensive feedback from a diverse pool of people on <emph>Work
In Progress</emph> papers involving machine learning on sensor systems (TinyML). The focus is on work
that combines sensor signals from the physical world with machine learning, particularly in ways that
are distributed to the device or use edge and fog computing. The development and deployment of ML
at the very edge remains a technological challenge constrained by computing, memory, energy,
network bandwidth and data privacy and security limitations. This is especially true for battery
operated devices and always-on use cases and applications. Our end goal is to help all attendees
design systems that are more scientifically advanced, robust to failure, efficient, and well validated.
