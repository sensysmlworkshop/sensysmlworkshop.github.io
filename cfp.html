  <p> The 1st Workshop on Machine Learning on Edge in Sensor Systems (SenSys-ML) is a workshop that focuses on innovative machine learning applications 
  in sensor networks that are resource constrained. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
<ul>
<li>Machine learning applications which occur on the device or the edge.</li>
<li>Innovative applications of machine learning to sensor network data, particularly in ways that minimize resource consumption in the network.</li>
<li>Applications of machine learning on mobile devices.</li>
</ul>

As for references, submissions may include as many pages as needed. All submissions must use the LaTeX (preferred) or Word styles found <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">here</a>. LaTeX submissions should use the acmart.cls template (sigconf option), with the default 9-pt font. This format will be used also for the camera-ready version of accepted papers. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the <a href="https://sensys19.hotcrp.com/">conference submission system</a>. Accepted submissions will be available on the ACM digital library at least one week before the conference.</li>
<li>Work In Progress, which is a presentation-only format. We request a <strong>1 single spaced 8.5” x 11” page</strong> abstract submission. Please note that these submissions will not be published as this is a presentation-only format.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<!-- h3 id="camera-ready">Guidelines for preparing the camera-ready draft</h3>
Authors should use the <a href="/2018/resources/documents/SenSysTemplate.7z">SenSysTemplate</a> file for preparing their camera-ready draft. Authors have to select the \setcopyright{} line, based on their response to ACM's message. Once authors complete their copyright release forms with ACM, they get the DOI and modify the \doi{} line accordingly.</p>

<p>The final camera-ready draft should be submitted through the <a href="http://hotcrp.andrew.cmu.edu/sensys2018/">web submission form</a>.</p -->
